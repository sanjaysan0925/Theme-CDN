# Theme-CDN
This project implements a centralized CDN using GitHub Pages to manage common CSS, JavaScript, and assets for multiple websites. By linking all sites to a single CDN repository, any theme or design update is applied instantly everywhere, ensuring consistency, faster maintenance, and cost-free global content delivery.
